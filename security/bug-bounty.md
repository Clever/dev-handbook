Clever is committed to working with security experts around the world to stay up to date with the latest security techniques. If you have discovered a security issue that you believe we should know about, we'd love to hear from you. You can read about our security and privacy efforts on our [security page](https://clever.com/security).

Coordinated disclosure rules
----------------------------
* Please let us know as soon as possible upon discovery of a potential security issue, and weâ€™ll make every effort to quickly correct the issue.
* Provide us with a reasonable amount of time to fix the issue before publishing it elsewhere.
* Make a good faith effort to not leak, manipulate, or destroy any user data, or affect the availability of the site. Please only test against accounts you own yourself or with explicit permission of the account holder.
* Please refrain from automated/scripted account creation.

Bounty eligibility
------------------
Vulnerabilities are eligible for the bug bounty program if they meet a minimum severity threshold. To qualify for a reward under this program, the vulnerability should:

* Represent an active threat to the confidentiality or integrity of Clever user data.
* Be possible to mitigate through standard defensive measures.
* Include a clear description along with steps to reproduce, including attachments such as screenshots or proof of concept code as necessary.

In general, the following would not meet the threshold for severity:
* Vulnerabilities on sites hosted by third-parties unless they lead to a vulnerability on the Clever services.
* Denial of service, spamming, or causing annoyance.
* Issues with Clever's email server configuration (SPF, DKIM, and DMARC) or name server configuration (DNSSec).
* Issues that can't be obviously exploited, like self-XSS (an XSS that requires the user to enter a payload that is executed against themselves).
* Login/logout CSRF.
* Vulnerabilities affecting users of unsupported or unpatched browsers and platforms.

Clever also reserves the right to deny eligibility for a vulnerability that was previously reported or discovered internally.
* Be the first to report a specific vulnerability.
* Disclose the vulnerability report directly and exclusively to us. Public disclosure or disclosure to other third parties, including vulnerability brokers, before we address your report will cause you to forfeit the reward.
