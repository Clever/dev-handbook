Clever is committed to working with security experts across the world to stay up to date with the latest security techniques. If you have discovered a security issue that you believe we should know about, we'd welcome working with you. You can read about our security and privacy efforts on our [security page](https://clever.com/security)

**Coordinated disclosure rules**

* Please let us know as soon as possible upon discovery of a potential security issue, and weâ€™ll make every effort to quickly correct the issue.
* Provide us a reasonable amount of time to fix the issue before publishing it elsewhere.
* Making a good faith effort to not leak, manipulate, or destroy any user data. Please only test against accounts you own yourself or with explicit permission of the account holder.
* Please refrain from automated/scripted account creation.

**Bounty eligibility**

Clever reserves the right to decide if the minimum severity threshold is met and whether it was previously reported. To qualify for a reward under this program, you should:

* Be the first to report a specific vulnerability.
* Send a clear textual description of the report along with steps to reproduce the vulnerability. Include attachments such as screenshots or proof of concept code as necessary.
* Disclose the vulnerability report directly and exclusively to us. Public disclosure or disclosure to other third parties -- including vulnerability brokers -- before we addressed your report will forfeit the reward.

In general, the following would not meet the threshold for severity:
* Vulnerabilities on sites hosted by third-parties unless they lead to a vulnerability on the main website
* Denial of service
* Spamming
* Email server configuration (SPF, DKIM, and DMARC)
* Name server configuration (DNSSec)
* Self-XSS (an XSS that requires the user to enter a payload)

Thank you for helping keep Clever safe!

**Thanks**

We believe in recognizing the work of others.

If your work helps us improve the security of our service. we'd be happy to [acknowledge your contribution](/Clever/thanks) and ensure you are fairly rewarded for your discovery.
