## Purpose
when you write stuff, you have no concern about when and how it's going to be deployed

## Things to think about
- Both upstream and downstream systems might be affected by your change.
- have a sense of what needs to be done to get it deployed
- spec should have info on it -> unless it's just agent changes, etc that already have processes around them AND no deps

## Example scenarios

## Link to deploy tools
- jira subtask!!!
  - checklist of items
     - config changes
     - actual line by line items you need to deploy
     - upstream and downstream affected projects / systems
