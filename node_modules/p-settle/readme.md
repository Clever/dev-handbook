# p-settle [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/sindresorhus/p-settle.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/github/sindresorhus/p-settle)

> Settle promises concurrently and get their fulfillment value or rejection reason

## Install

```
$ npm install p-settle
```

## Usage

```js
const {promises: fs} = require('fs');
const pSettle = require('p-settle');

(async () => {
	const files = [
		'a.txt',
		'b.txt' // Doesn't exist
	].map(fileName => fs.readFile(fileName, 'utf8'));

	console.log(await pSettle(files));
	/*
	[
		{
			isFulfilled: true,
			isRejected: false,
			value: 'ðŸ¦„'
		},
		{
			isFulfilled: false,
			isRejected: true,
			reason: [Error: ENOENT: no such file or directory, open 'b.txt']
		}
	]
	*/
})();
```

## API

### pSettle(array, options?)

Returns a `Promise<object[]>` that is fulfilled when all promises from the `array` argument are settled.

The objects in the array have the following properties:

- `isFulfilled`
- `isRejected`
- `value` or `reason` *(Depending on whether the promise fulfilled or rejected)*

#### array

Type: `Array<ValueType | PromiseLike<ValueType> | ((...args: any[]) => PromiseLike<ValueType>)>`

The array can contain a mix of any value, promise, and async function. Promises are awaited. Async functions are executed and awaited. The `concurrency` option only works for elements that are async functions.

#### options

Type: `object`

##### concurrency

Type: `number` (Integer)\
Default: `Infinity`\
Minimum: `1`

Number of concurrently pending promises.

**Note:** This only limits concurrency for elements that are async functions, not promises.
