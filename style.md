# Style

This document explains the standards we have around code style in various different languages.
Style is important to standardize for a few reasons:

* Makes code more readable, and thus easier to understand.
* Avoids holy wars over small details, but still encourages an approach to coding that sweats the details.

For each of the languages below we link to a style guide reference and outline tools to use in order to help follow the style guide.
These tools should be part of every project's build and test cycle.
As a code reviewer, you should hold people accountable to following the style guide for the appropriate language.

## Go

## CoffeeScript

## Python

## Bash

The [Google Shell Style Guide](https://google-styleguide.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/shell.xml) is what we follow for shell scripts.
There are no automated tools that we use for following this, however there is [ShellCheck](http://www.shellcheck.net/about.html) which covers some of what's in the style guide.
